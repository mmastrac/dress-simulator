# Opinionated Dress Color Simulator

This is an HTML5 visualization that allows you to fade between the "correct" visualization of the image on the left, 
and the "incorrect" version on the right.

Slide the control from side-to-side to fade between the three images: a "blue" version where we subtract out the 
theoretical color of the light, the original picture, and a "gold" version where the blue has been significantly 
reduced.

Obviously the simulation's labels are biased.
