# Opinionated Dress Color Simulator

This is an HTML5 visualization that allows you to fade between the "blue/black" visualization of the image on the left, 
and the "white/gold" version on the right.

Slide the control from side-to-side to fade between the three images: a "blue/black" version where we subtract out 
the theoretical color of the light (#524922), the original picture, and a "white/gold" version where we add color to 
compensate for the perceived shadow (#392c00).
