# Opinionated Dress Color Simulator

This is an HTML5 visualization that allows you to fade between the "correct" visualization of the image on the left, 
and the "incorrect" version on the right.

Obviously the simulation's labels are biased.

Note that fading between images using opacity like this results in midway images that are a bit too bright. 
Suggestions on how to fix this are welcome.
